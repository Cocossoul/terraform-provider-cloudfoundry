## Governance

The backlog is kept as github issues annotated with labels and milestones, and progress is tracked in the [backlog project](https://github.com/mevansam/terraform-provider-cf/projects/1).

Please send PR against the `dev` branches.

You may reach core contributors in the [cloudfoundry slack, within the terraform channel](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/C7JRBR8CV/) (get an account from http://slack.cloudfoundry.org/). Please prefer slack channel for support requests, and github issues for qualified bugs and enhancements requests.

## Compliance

Linters are run as part of the travis build. Detected flaws will prevent the merge of the PR.

Contributors can run the same checks locally using the procedure:

1. Install dependencies

- gometalinter tool: ```go get gopkg.in/alecthomas/gometalinter.v2```
- gometalinter internal dependencies: ```gometalinter.v2 --install```

2. Run the linters on code: ```make check```

Fine tuning of the linters configuration can be done in the [.gometalinter.json](.gometalinter.json) file according to the tool [specification](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter#configuration-file)

## Running local acceptance tests

Local tests relies on pcf-dev, which is a local version of cloudfoundry components running is a VirtualBox machine.

1. Install dependencies

  - cf cli : follow [official procedure](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)

  - pcfdev plugin:
    - download plugin: [on pivotal website](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcfdev). You must register to access downloads.
    - install plugin: ```cf install-plugin pcfdev-v0.30.0+PCF1.11.0-linux```
    - run plugin: ```cf dev start```

  The last command will actually download a virtual machine template (this will take some time) then start the machine. Starting process is also quite long.


2. Run tests

  - export environment variables
    ```
    export CF_API_URL=https://api.local.pcfdev.io
    export CF_USER=admin
    export CF_PASSWORD=admin
    export CF_UAA_CLIENT_ID=admin
    export CF_UAA_CLIENT_SECRET=admin-client-secret
    export CF_CA_CERT=""
    export CF_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION=true
    ```

  - (optionnal) activate logs
    ```
    export CF_DEBUG=true
    export CF_TRACE=debug.log
    ```

  - run tests
    ```
    cd cloudfoundry
    TF_ACC=1 go test -v -timeout 120m .
    ```


## Creating a release

* Open up an issue "cutting release 0.9.9" to gather contributors concensus on when to cut the release
* On your clone, checkout the `dev` branch, and execute `scripts/create-release.sh 0.9.9`
* travis build kicks off for this tag, and tries to publish the artifacts github, check it on [travis the branch list](https://travis-ci.org/mevansam/terraform-provider-cf/branches)
* edit the release notes in the [github release page](https://github.com/mevansam/terraform-provider-cf/releases)
